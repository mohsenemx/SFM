If you are a normal user, you should NOT be here, download main app executable from
master branch, and run it on your device.


my files are safe, you can check it if you want.


If you know how to code then:
Download entire master branch,
open source folder, there should be a file called "main.cpp", that is main source of app and you can use it.
